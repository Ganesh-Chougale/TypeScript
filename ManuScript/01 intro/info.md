## TypeScript (TS)
**Superset of JavaScript:** TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, meaning it adds features to JavaScript while remaining compatible with it.  
**Static Typing:** Variables have defined data types at compile time, which can help catch errors early.  
**Optional Typing:** You can choose to use static typing or not, making it flexible for existing JavaScript projects.  
**Compilation:** TypeScript code is compiled into JavaScript before execution.  

So at the end Typescript is just wrapper arround javascript & we can visualize that with
